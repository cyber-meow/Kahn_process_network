We have re-generated the GT centroids as follows.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Birch 1:

The centroid locations were first optimized  by genetic algorihm (GA) 
[Fränti, Pat.Rec.Lett.2000]. The centroids form a 10x10 grid. Their
average distance was calculated as 92247. A grid using this parameter
was then manually fit for the data, and the result locations recorded 
as the ground truth centroids. Ground truth partition lables were
obtained by mapping each point to its nearest centroid.


Birch 2:

Centroid locations were first optimized by GA, and their average 
distance in x-axis was calculated as 9512 from the result. 
The centroids form a sine curve function:

  y(x) = amplitude * sin(2*pi*frequency*x + phaseshift) + offset

It was manually fit using parameters:

  Offset      =  43659
  Amplitude   =  -37819
  Phaseshift  =  20.8388
  Frequency   =  0.000004205

Ground truth centroids were then plotted in this curve and the
corresponding x and y(x) were recorded as the groung truth centroids.
Ground truth partitions were obtained by mapping each point to its
nearest centroid.


Birch 3:

Centroid locations were first optimized by GA, from which they were
manually tuned and their locations recorded as the ground truth.
Due to the overlap, ground truth partitions were not calculated.
